TODO: figure out why mux is null

TOASK:

    1. Currently I'm not able to start the sparse matrix benchmark because of my mux is null

        so the benchmark was stopped from this from StatusActivity: 
            if (mux == null || mux.vncDaemon == null
                    || mux.vncDaemon.csm == null 
                    || mux.vncDaemon.csm.userApp == null)
                return;

    I'm wondering if you could explain why there are different options of mux in the "if" check above.

    Those are just to protect against null pointer exceptions in case someone presses a button while the VCoreDaemon or any of the layers aren't actually running (as is the case when the app is first started. You have to put it into a valid region (try 0) first before it'll start running the VCoreDaemon).

    Mux may be null if the network stuff isn't working. Adhoc needs to be running and working before the app is started.
 
    2. I guess you only put all of JGF's stuff in UserApp? Yes

    3. What are VCoreDaemon, SparseRunner, Atom. The matrix is started in UserApp, which is in turn called by DSMLayer, but I am not sure how all the java classes fit together for the big picture.

    StatusActivity starts Mux and NetworkThread
    Mux starts VCoreDaemon
    VCoreDaemon starts DSMLayer.
    DSMLayer starts UserApp.
