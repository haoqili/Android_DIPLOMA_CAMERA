So, most of the data analysis is done. I ll take a second look at it
today, and collate all the power + other numbers into one mail and
send it out to all of you. Li Shiuan's aim from this was to figure out
if we needed a second trail (in addition to getting useful data for
the paper). From the looks of it, a second trial will probably not
give us better data unless we find a better place to run it in. Maybe
an open area on campus or something like that ?

In any case, now we have a robust app and are pretty familiar with
deployment modalities. So a new deployment should hopefully not be too
much of a problem. I 'll mail Li Shiuan today with the details and see
what she says.

At your end, it ll be nice if you can start writing up a description
of the app in it's most technical terms. This will be useful both for
your MEng and for the paper due May 11th. You can't commit it to the
paper SVN since it needs CSAIL accounts. But send me any text and I
can copy paste it into the paper.
