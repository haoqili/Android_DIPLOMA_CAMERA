4G bandwidth reduction (uncleaned log) :

DIPLOMA :

Total json bytes : 1502405

Cloud : 3819148 + 13375630 (requests + responses) = 17194778

Number of get+take DIPLOMA requests :  Copying from above (80+74) = 154

Number of get+ take Cloud requests :       225+345=570

> diplo-take         80      54
> diplo-get          74      15
> cloud-take        225     202
> cloud-get         345     314

Therefore, 4G bytes per transaction of DIPLOMA is 1502405/154=9755
(considerably larger than 700 for the 3G stuff reported above, because
there people weren't moving)
Similarly, 4G bytes per transaction of CameraCloud is 30166 bytes
(somewhat lower than the 3g value).
