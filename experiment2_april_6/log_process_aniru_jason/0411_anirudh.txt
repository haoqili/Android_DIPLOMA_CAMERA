We modified scripts a bit to make it more robust. Currently 3G logs
have been somewhat cleaned up, 4G logs are still a little noisy. In
any case, here are the results after more robust scripts :

4G
Type           Total  Success
diplo-take         80      54
diplo-get          74      15
cloud-take        225     202
cloud-get         345     314

3G

diplo-take         74      73
diplo-get         128      39
cloud-take         70      62
cloud-get         106      95

Note that 3G results have been cleaned up a bit by throwing away
spurious phone logs that weren't part of the experiment.

Latency  in ms :

Notes on Wifi :

mean      558
median    205
std-dev   991

This is after discarding > 6000 ms samples (due to time out).
Conclusion : there are some requests that finish very very late ie in
4 seconds or so. Maybe the phone is overloaded ?

Nexus on Wifi :

mean      263
median    205
std-dev   276

Nexus on 3G :

mean    22546
median  15557
std-dev 20284

Notes on 4G :

mean      837
median    479
std-dev   769

Bandwidth reduction :

For the 3G experiment (Would be good if someone double checked, these
are from the manually-filtered last experiment 3G logs, so they should
be accurate) :

Total count of all bytes corresponding to string "json" in the files
is 158983 bytes. These "json" requests spanned only 5 lines in total,
meaning leader elections were rare. This was the case with the second
experiment There are a total of 74+128, take and get results for
DIPLOMA. The average 3G byte cost per transaction is :
(158983/(74+128)) which is 788 bytes.

On 3G, for each transaction, get or take, there is a request and a
response. The number of bytes in cloud-requests is 976346 in total.
For cloud responses this is a huge 7142626. There are  70 cloud takes
and 106 gets in all. The average 3-G usage per transaction (take or
get ) is  46130 bytes.

Now that the method is clear,here are the 4G results on bandwidth
reduction .I am lapsing in and out of sleep, so will do 4G in the
morning.
