Note that 3G results have been cleaned up a bit by throwing away spurious phone logs that weren't part of the experiment. We haven't cleaned up for 4G yet. 

Latency  in ms :

mean      558             837
median    205             479
std-dev   991             769


This is after discarding > 6000 ms samples (due to time out).
Conclusion : there are some requests that finish very very late ie in
4 seconds or so. Maybe the phone is overloaded ?

Bandwidth reduction :


Total count of all bytes corresponding to string "json" in the files
is 158983 bytes. These "json" requests spanned only 5 lines in total,
meaning leader elections were rare. This was the case with the second
experiment There are a total of 74+128, take and get results for
DIPLOMA. The average 3G byte cost per transaction is :
(158983/(74+128)) which is 788 bytes.

On 3G, for each transaction, get or take, there is a request and a
response. The number of bytes in cloud-requests is 976346 in total.
For cloud responses this is a huge 7142626. There are  70 cloud takes
and 106 gets in all. The average 3-G usage per transaction (take or
get ) is  46130 bytes.

DIPLOMA : 788
CameraCloud : 46130 

4G bandwidth reduction (uncleaned log) :

DIPLOMA :

Total json bytes : 1502405

Cloud : 3819148 + 13375630 (requests + responses) = 17194778

Number of get+take DIPLOMA requests :  Copying from above (80+74) = 154

Number of get+ take Cloud requests :       225+345=570

Therefore, 4G bytes per transaction of DIPLOMA is 1502405/154=9755
(considerably larger than 700 for the 3G stuff reported above, because
there people weren't moving)
Similarly, 4G bytes per transaction of CameraCloud is 30166 bytes
(somewhat lower than the 3g value).

DIPLOMA : 9755
CameraCloud : 30166


Conclusions :

Completion rate improves if stationary
Cloud accesses improve if stationary
Latencies should be reported as median and not mean, cause are mean is skewed by some outliers
4G latencies are comparable to Wifi
3G latencies are still much worse
Completion rates are bad compared to Cloud only
Completion rates are better for takes than gets
