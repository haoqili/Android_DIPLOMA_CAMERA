This project is going to be modifying Jason's DIPLOMAMatrix that does sparse matrix multiplication into an app that shares images taken from Android's cameras.

TO FIX
=========
I set 2 phones to region 1, but they both claim to be leaders of region 1!!  (They can send and receive UDP packets between themselves)

Troubleshooting
============

* Fatal exception in "Set Region" and "Set" is caused by not putting in anything in the textboxes
