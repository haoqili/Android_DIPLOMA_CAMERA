This project is going to be modifying Jason's DIPLOMAMatrix that does sparse matrix multiplication into an app that shares images taken from Android's cameras.

Troubleshooting
============

* Can't broadcast: make sure Globals.BROADCAST_ADDRESS="192.168.5.255", not "192.168.255.255"

* Fatal exception in "Set Region" and "Set" is caused by not putting in anything in the textboxes
